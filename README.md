## ML Mushroom Classification ##

Classifies mushrooms as poisonous or edible based on 22 different attributes using comparison between various models via Decision Tree Learner, Random Forest Ensemble Learner, k-Nearest Neighbor, Logistic Regression, and Neural Network Implementation using Keras with Theano as backend.

Analysis and comparison of loss and accuracy, of various optimizer are plotted.

Optimizers under review are as follow:
- Adam 
- RMSprop 
- Adagrad
- Stochastic Gradient Descent(SGD)
